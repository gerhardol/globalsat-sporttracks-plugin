===Changes===

3.2.102 2011-12-02 (ongoing)
 * Plugin GUID was changed after 3.1.3. Uninstall previous 3.2.* versions prior to installing this version.
 * Pauses were inserted in some situation, but ST did not save the pauses if they contained milliseconds. Workaround done, pauses are now always estimated to full seconds.
 * Lap info: Cadence and Power were added as 0. This was only visible in .fitlog exports.
 * Lap Distance markers set.
 * Possibility to cancel import for 625XT.
 
3.2.94 2011-12-01 (ongoing)
See [Features] for major changes.
 * Many changes to device handling. For instance can Globalsat devices be autodetected, using GS-Sport import device. This handling is always used when the plugin is accessed from other plugins.
 * Implemented known Globalsat protocols (several moved from Waypoints). Some functionality is accessible from this plugin, some from other plugins. See [Features].
 * Device check: The plugin checks that the identification matches for the device you try to import from. If you have more than one device connected, the plugin will now import from the correct device.
 * Some tweaking of device detection, should be a little faster.
 * SendRoutes did probably not work at all before (except for KeyMaze?)

3.2.12 2011-10-12
 * GH-625XT support

3.1.3 2011-07-01
 * Latest update from ZoneFiveSoftware
